🧪 How the Recommendation Works

User selects mood 🎭

User enters intent (e.g. “music”, “learning”, “podcast”)

Mood keywords + intent are converted into vectors

Cosine similarity finds the closest content match

Top recommendations are ranked & displayed

Confidence score is shown

User feedback is collected 👍👎

🧠 Example Use Case

Mood: 😌 Relaxed
Intent: “chill music”

✅ Output:

Chill Lo-Fi Beats

Emotional Healing Podcast

Feel-Good Comedy Show

With confidence score & explanations.
